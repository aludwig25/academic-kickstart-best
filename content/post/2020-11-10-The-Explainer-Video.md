Given the current pandemic, all academic conferences have shifted online; some more successfully than others! This year, I was lucky enough to be selected to give a short talk on a panel about public musicology, and of course I chose to speak about my work making videos on the Dies irae. Here is a link to my (slightly stuffy) academic talk. It's not exactly a "how-to" video, but more of a behind-the-scenes look at some of my (admittedly unique) decisions.
